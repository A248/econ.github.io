### Whether economics is limited in scope?

**Objection 1**: It would seem that economics is narrowly focused. For an economy is concerned with production and consumption, and likewise it is measured as such. As economics is the study of the economy, it is constrained to simple production and consumption.

**Objection 2**: It is well-known that the benefits of economic endeavours may clash with that of the environment, some of whose benefit is immaterial. Thus the intangible may be pitted against the material. Therefore economics does not concern itself with immaterial things, for a subject may not contradict itself.

**Objection 3**: The scope of a study is defined by its adherents. But economists very precisely focus on some matters and ignore others. Therefore economics is likewise restrained.

**On the contrary**, economics is concerned with the maximisation of efficiency, that the benefits of a course of action prevail over costs. Accordingly economics is limited only to situations of cost and benefit.

**I answer that**, any course of action may be evaluated according to its costs and benefits. This process of evaluation is said to be economics. Thus is the simple definition of the term.

Economics, however, as it applies to matters of policy, is further limited. For there are those individual actions ignored for the sake of consistency; whereas economic policy regards the whole, and anything which may better that whole, the evaluation of individual actions is only undertaken by an individual. Thus where voluntary movement regards individual actions, economics presumes the collective results of voluntary movement and acts accordingly.

**Reply to Objection 1**: Consumption is undertaken as a means to the greater end of living standards. There are other means, the likes of which economics does not commonly apply to, but to which, properly speaking, economics does concern.

**Reply to Objection 2**: Benefits of the environment remain such, no matter perceptions of a distinction, costs likewise. It is a perversion of economics that the benefits of non-material goods be subordinate to the material.

**Reply to Objection 3**: The study of a subject is different from that to which the subject applies. Thus "history" is an immutable sequence of past events, but also a focus of historians. For the purpose of clarity, this certain respect of the term should best be referred to as the study of economics.

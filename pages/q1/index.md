### Whether economics is limited in scope?

**Objection 1**: It would seem that economics is narrowly focused. For an economy is concerned with production and consumption of material goods, and likewise it is measured as such. As economics is the study of the economy, it is constrained to simple production and consumption.

**Objection 2**: It is well-known that the benefits of economic endeavours may clash with that of the environment, some of whose benefit is immaterial. Thus the intangible may be pitted against the material. Therefore economics does not concern itself with immaterial things, for a subject may not contradict itself.

**Objection 3**: The scope of a study is defined by its adherents. But economists very precisely focus on some matters and ignore others. Therefore economics is likewise restrained.
